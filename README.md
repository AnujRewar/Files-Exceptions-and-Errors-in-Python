# Files-Exceptions-and-Errors-in-Python
1.In 1st file I have shown that how can we open and read a file in python

2.In 2nd file I have shown that how can we write, amend, and read a file in python with error handling if file not present.

Important note: The write and amend command both are used for writing code in a file but the difference between both of them is write replaces the text that is present inside that file with the one that we provides 
and amend just add the text in the file next to the text that is already present there.
